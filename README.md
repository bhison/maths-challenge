# Maths Challenge

Hey! You! Why are you so *cringeworthily* bad at maths, you excruciatingly dim sonva beehive? OMG, really?! 🙈 Are you serious right now?! Please! I don't know, maybe it's because you -- you use a flipping *calculator* 📱 all the time instead of actually engaging in passive practice with mental arhythmatic which would naturally condition your mathematics skills? 🧠 

And, *no*, I am not sure if that's how that word is spelt but, actually, how about you get off your high horse 🐴 yeah and stick with the matter in hand rather than - ha! Yeah, I see, nice try actually - rather than trying to make it about *my* spelling, huh? Typical you! I am fuly aware of what this 👇 is, really, and I'm sorry, truly sorry in fact, but it is just 👏 not 👏 going 👏 to 👏 work 👏! So bad luck! You lose! Bad luck to you, you weak, weak, sad person!

Come play Maths Challenge. Figure out how to make one number from a bunch of other numbers. You can do it. Don't be scared.
